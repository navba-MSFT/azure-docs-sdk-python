    description: 'The identifier of the producer group that this producer is associated
      with when

      publishing to the associated partition. The producer group is only recognized
      and relevant when certain features

      of the producer are enabled. For example, it is used by idempotent publishing.

    description: 'The owner level indicates that publishing is intended to be performed
      exclusively for

      events in the requested partition in the context of the associated producer
      group. To do so, publishing will

      attempt to assert ownership over the partition; in the case where more than
      one publisher in the producer

      group attempts to assert ownership for the same partition, the one having a
      larger owner_level value will "win".

      The owner level is only recognized and relevant when certain features of the
      producer are enabled. For example,

      it is used by idempotent publishing.

      The owner level should be in the range from 0 to max signed short (2^16 - 1)
